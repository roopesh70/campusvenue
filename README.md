 #Smart Campus Utility â€“ Auditorium Booking & Permissions System

Use Case: Our college has many clubs, organizations and events happening. And all those need spaces like class rooms, seminar halls, offices etc  to conduct the event. These spaces are limited in number and a clash can occur when two or more parties need the same space at the same time. And if one party gets the permission, the others cannot know immediately if that venue is available. 
Students and faculty often face delays and confusion while booking college venues due to unclear procedures and manual approvals.
Challenge: The current process to reserve auditoriums, labs, or seminar halls is inefficient, requires multiple offline approvals, and lacks transparency.

Problem Statement: Build a web or mobile application that digitizes and streamlines the entire venue booking process for colleges. The system should support role-based request creation (student/club/faculty), slot availability checks and other important features
Additional Ideas:
* Admin dashboard for facility managers
* Conflict resolution system (e.g., auto-reschedule)
* Upload documents like permission letters.
